## 🧠 Task Descriptions

### ✅ Task 1: ER Diagram Design
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (`Company ERD.png`) representing the company's organizational structure, employees, departments, and relationships.

### ✅ Task 2: Relational Schema Mapping
The relational schema (`Company Schema.png`) maps the ER diagram into a set of relational tables, including keys and relationships.

### ✅ Task 3: SQL Implementation
The file `SQL Implementation.sql` contains the SQL statements required to:
- Create the tables as per the relational schema.
- Define primary and foreign key constraints.
- Set appropriate data types and constraints.

## 💡 How to Use

1. Open the `.sql` file in a SQL editor (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench).
2. Run the script to create the database structure.
3. Use the ERD and relational schema images as references for understanding the design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- SQL
- ER Modeling
- Relational Schema Mapping
- SQL Server / MySQL (compatible SQL syntax)
